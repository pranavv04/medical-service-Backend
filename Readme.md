Healthcare Service API Project Setup
Description
This project is a simple API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for managing healthcare services. It allows you to add, update, delete, and retrieve services.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)
Git (for cloning the repository)
Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Replace your-username/your-repo-name with the actual GitHub username and repository name.

Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Install Dependencies: Use npm to install all required dependencies specified in package.json:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env File: Create a .env file in the root directory of your project to store your environment variables.

Add the following environment variable to connect to MongoDB:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
Replace your_mongo_connection_string with the MongoDB URI for your database.
If using MongoDB Atlas, it should look something like: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/mydatabase.
Run the Server: Start the server by running:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will start running on http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port in .env).
Testing the API:

Use a tool like Postman to test your API endpoints.
You can import the Postman collection provided in the project to simplify testing.
API Endpoints
POST /service/addservice: Add a new healthcare service (requires serviceName, description, and price).
GET /service/getservices: Retrieve all available services.
GET /service/:id: Retrieve a service by its ID.
PUT /service/updateservice/:id: Update an existing service by ID.
DELETE /service/deleteservice/:id: Delete a service by ID.
Additional Notes
Ensure MongoDB is running or accessible (locally or via MongoDB Atlas) when starting the server.
If any issues arise, check the console output for errors and verify your MongoDB URI in .env is correct.
Deployment (Optional)
If you wish to deploy the project, use services like Heroku, Render, or Vercel for Node.js applications.
